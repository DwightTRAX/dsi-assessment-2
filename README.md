# Week 2 Assessment

Welcome to the second week of Zipfian!

* Time: 60 minutes
* Open book
* Individual

## Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to fill in each function stub in `assessment.py` according to its docstring and make the associated test pass. The repository structure is below for reference. `assessment.py` is under `src` directory.

There are 10 questions in `assessment.py` over these topics in this order:

* general Python (4 questions)
* pandas (3 questions)
* SQL (3 questions)

We recommend skimming over all the questions and solving the ones that you are most confident about first.

## Running Unit Tests

All the questions in this assessment can be tested using the unit tests. You can run the tests with this command from the root directory (assessment-2/):
        `make test`

If you do not unittest2 or py.test, you may see errors. Run the following commands in case you see errors related to these:
        `pip install unittest2`
        `pip install pytest`

## Repository Structure

The repository has the following folder structure:

        assessment-2
        ├── Makefile
        ├── README.md
        ├── src
