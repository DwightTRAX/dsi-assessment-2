# Week 2 Assessment

Welcome to the second week of Zipfian!

* Time: 60 minutes
* Open book
* Individual

## Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to fill in each function stub in `assessment.py` according to its docstring and make the associated test pass.

There are 10 questions over these topics in this order:

* general Python (4 questions)
* pandas (3 questions)
* SQL (3 questions)

We recommend skimming over all the questions and solving the ones that you are most confident about first.

You can run the test with this command from the root directory:

    python test/unittests.py

Good luck!
